	<p style="font-size: 40px"> Introduction
		Draft your introduction, saving your thesis statement for the last sentence of the introduction for impact. Start the introduction with something catchy to engage the reader into wanting to read the rest of your essay. Some students prefer to leave writing the introduction for their last step and write it once the rest of the paper is drafted.

		Compose Essay Body
		Compose the body of the essay which include the supporting paragraphs. Make sure the paragraphs relate to the thesis statement and also transition smoothly. Write each paragraph as if it could stand alone in the essay, being sure to introduce the issue and complete the thought with a closing sentence.

		Conclusion
		Finally, write the conclusion to wrap up the paper. Summarize the main points discussed in the body and briefly explain how the thesis statement proves true given the information given in the essay. Remember, this is your first draft so you might expect the draft essay to run longer than one page initially.

		Editing
		Edit your essay by trimming away any fluff or excess words. Condense words and sentences to shorten the length without weakening your paper. Do as much cutting as you can and then recheck the length. If it is still over one-page long, you may need to consider whether you are trying to cram in too many points. Do not try to cheat the assignment by minimizing your computer font or reducing the margins of your paper so that you can fit more words on each line. Most likely, your professor is keen to these tricks and will require you to use type 12 font with one-inch left and right margins.

		Proofread
		Review your paper draft for punctuation, grammatical or other errors that might cost you points. Make sure the essay is written in an informational and academic tone and check to make you have followed your professor's instructions exactly.
